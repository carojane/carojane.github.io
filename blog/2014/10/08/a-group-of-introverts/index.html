<div class="entry-content"><p>I had promised myself that no matter what, I would keep up my weekly blogging throughout the duration of Launch Academy. That, of course broke down when it came time for group projects.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My group project was frustrating. From what I&rsquo;ve learned talking to the EEs, this is a normal reaction. Actually, reflecting on it now, now that it&rsquo;s over and done with, I&rsquo;m glad for the experience.</p>

<p>Somebody made a comment about my group, that the four of us were the biggest introverts in the entire cohort. Fair enough, though the phrase I used was &ldquo;independent workers&rdquo;. I enjoy being an introvert, even when I also enjoy working with others. Usually, I let more outgoing people take the lead and offer support, creativity and reliability. I know my strengths.</p>

<p>Being in a group with no natural leader forced me to step into the role - in my own way - and made me realize what I value in group work.</p>

<p>I like using collaborative brainstorming as a way to generate ideas and solve problems. In my group it felt like hitting a brick wall when we were coming up with our project idea - I was the only one offering suggestions and they were all torn apart with criticism. I&rsquo;m more inspired to work on a project when my coworkers are offering creative input as well.</p>

<p>I also appreciate structure in the workflow. Having set milestones and goals that everyone knows helps the entire team stay on track. For my individual project, I have a running to-do list and a daily list of objectives.</p>

<p>Communication is vital in group work. It has been something in the past that I&rsquo;ve had a hard time with, but I&rsquo;ve learned to make it a priority. A few times, we had a team member who would work on a feature, only to find out that someone else had already finished it. He was frequently absent and late, and didn&rsquo;t make much of an effort to communicate (mostly listen) so wasn&rsquo;t able to contribute much to the project.</p>

<p>In the same vein, feedback and self evaluation is important as well - both of the work and the group dynamics. I called a meeting to discuss our communication issues early in the second week, and while it didn&rsquo;t solve all the problems, it got the entire group on the same page.</p>

<p>I felt like I stepped into a leadership role for the project, though in a hands off way. I suppose I was just taking initiative and being proactive, which is what I would hope anyone working in a team would do. It was very frustrating dealing with a team member who refused to do that.</p>

<p>I do enjoy working alone. For bigger projects, I really do like working in a group, knowing that project features will be added while I can focus on my own task. A good group, in my opinion, is one where team members can come together collaboratively, but also can work independently.</p>

<p>So, while my group project was so very frustrating, and while I&rsquo;m proud but not ecstatic about the end result, I learned so much from the experience that I will take with me into my future jobs.</p>
